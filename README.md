# Quizify

Quizify is a quiz application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and designed with Bootstrap. Users can easily take quizzes created by admins and view their quiz history. Admins have full control over the platform, including creating, viewing, and deleting quizzes. Additionally, admins can track which users have taken a quiz and their respective scores. With a user-friendly interface and seamless experience, Quizify makes quizzing fun and interactive for both users and administrators.
